# Specification Quality Checklist: Dev Bot Management Page (CRUD)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec passed initial validation. Ready for planning.
- All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are covered with independent user stories
- User stories are prioritized appropriately (P1: View List, Create; P2: View Details, Update; P3: Delete)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover common scenarios like concurrent edits, validation errors, and permission issues
